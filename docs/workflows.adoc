# Workflows

== Workflow configurations
A workflow configuration file is a file that defines the steps and tasks needed to execute a particular workflow or process. It typically specifies the order in which tasks should be executed, any dependencies between tasks, and any inputs or parameters needed by each task.

Workflow configuration files are used to automate tasks and processes, such as building and deploying software applications, running data pipelines, or executing machine learning workflows. They provide a way to define the steps needed to complete a complex task and automate the execution of those steps.

Workflow configuration files are written in YAML format. They are versioned and stored in a version control system, allowing engineers to collaborate on workflows and track changes over time.

== Tasks and Steps
In a workflow configuration file, a task is a specific action that needs to be performed, while a step is a logical grouping of one or more tasks.

Steps, are a way to group related tasks together into a logical unit. For example, in a software development workflow, a step might involve building and testing the application, or packaging and deploying the application to a server. Steps can also define dependencies between tasks, specifying the order in which they should be executed.

Tasks are the individual units of work that need to be completed in order to execute a workflow. For example, in a software development workflow, a task might involve compiling code, running unit tests, or packaging an application. Each task typically has a specific input, output, and set of actions that need to be performed.

== Call, Execute, and Run

In computer science, the terms "call", "execute", and "run" are often used to describe the process of invoking a function or program. While these terms are often used interchangeably, there are subtle differences between them:

- Call: Refers to the act of invoking a function or method by its name, along with any necessary arguments. The function call may or may not actually execute immediately, depending on the program flow and context.

- Execute: Refers to the act of actually running a program or script. Execution may involve loading the program into memory, allocating resources, setting up the program environment, and then executing the code.

- Run: Refers to the act of executing a program or script from start to finish, including any necessary initialization, processing, and cleanup steps. When a program is run, it is typically loaded into memory, executed, and then terminated.

In summary, while "call", "execute", and "run" are related concepts in computer science, they refer to different stages of the process of invoking a function or program, and may involve different levels of control and granularity depending on the context.
