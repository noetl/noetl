== Workflow configurations
A workflow configuration file is a file that defines the steps and tasks needed to execute a particular workflow or process. It typically specifies the order in which tasks should be executed, any dependencies between tasks, and any inputs or parameters needed by each task.

Workflow configuration files are used to automate tasks and processes, such as building and deploying software applications, running data pipelines, or executing machine learning workflows. They provide a way to define the steps needed to complete a complex task and automate the execution of those steps.

Workflow configuration files are written in YAML format. They are versioned and stored in a version control system, allowing engineers to collaborate on workflows and track changes over time.

== Jobs, Tasks, and Steps
- Job: A job is the highest level of abstraction in a workflow. It typically refers to a complete unit of work that needs to be executed, such as building and deploying a software application, or running a machine learning workflow.

- Step: A step is a logical grouping of one or more tasks that need to be performed in sequence. For example, in a software development workflow, a step might involve building and testing the application, or packaging and deploying the application to a server. Steps can also define dependencies between tasks, specifying the order in which they should be executed.

- Task: A task is a specific action or operation that needs to be performed as part of a job. Tasks are typically defined in terms of inputs, outputs, and actions, and may have dependencies on other tasks or data. For example, in a software development workflow, a task might involve compiling code, running unit tests, or packaging an application. 


In general, jobs are the highest-level unit of work in a workflow, while tasks and steps provide more fine-grained control over the individual actions that need to be performed. The choice of terminology may vary, but the general concepts of jobs, tasks, and steps provide a useful way to organize and structure complex workflows.

== Call, Execute, and Run

In computer science, the terms "call", "execute", and "run" are often used to describe the process of invoking a function or program. While these terms are often used interchangeably, there are subtle differences between them:

- Call: Refers to the act of invoking a function or method by its name, along with any necessary arguments. The function call may or may not actually execute immediately, depending on the program flow and context.

- Execute: Refers to the act of actually running a program or script. Execution may involve loading the program into memory, allocating resources, setting up the program environment, and then executing the code.

- Run: Refers to the act of executing a program or script from start to finish, including any necessary initialization, processing, and cleanup steps. When a program is run, it is typically loaded into memory, executed, and then terminated.

In summary, while "call", "execute", and "run" are related concepts in computer science, they refer to different stages of the process of invoking a function or program, and may involve different levels of control and granularity depending on the context.

=== The difference between processes and threads

==== Processes and threads are both related to the execution of code in a computer system, but they have some differences.
. Processes:
- A process is an instance of a running program that has its own memory space, resources, and file handles.  
- Each process runs independently of other processes and has its own state, meaning that it does not share memory or resources with other processes.  
- Processes are managed by the operating system, which assigns each process a unique process identifier (PID).  
- Processes can communicate with each other through inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like pipes, sockets, or shared memory.  
- Creating a new process is resource-intensive because it requires allocating separate memory space and resources for each process.  

. Threads:
- A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process.  
- Multiple threads can exist within a single process, and they share the same memory space and resources, such as file handles.  
- Threads are more lightweight compared to processes, as they share resources with other threads in the same process.  
- Since threads share memory, they can communicate with each other more efficiently than processes, but this also introduces potential issues, such as race conditions and deadlocks if not handled properly.  
- Threads are managed by the operating system or a runtime environment, and each thread has its own state and execution context, such as program counter, register values, and stack.  

The operating system manages processes by allocating resources, scheduling their execution, and handling communication between them. Processes are isolated from each other, and the operating system ensures that they do not interfere with one another, which provides stability and security in a multi-process environment.
