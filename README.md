# NoETL
NoETL's (Not Only ETL) current python version is a prototype of a system to manage the sequence of the process execution by controlling forks and child processes. 

Functionality of the prototype is described on wiki - https://github.com/noetl/noetl/wiki

## Quick Start

To execute the process assuming you've just cloned the repo to ~/projects/github folder, simply run:

    python ~/projects/github/noetl/noetl/noetl.py ~/projects/github/noetl/conf/coursor.inherit.cfg.v1.json

An output of execution should look like this example:

[https://github.com/noetl/noetl/blob/master/log/noetl-20150916163103.log](https://github.com/noetl/noetl/blob/master/log/noetl-20150916163103.log)
