// This script should do the following:
// 1. Request BTC/USD exchange rate from 3 different cryptocurrency exchanges using their public APIs. 
// The calls to exchanges shall be done in parallel.
// 2. Receive a response from each exchange and transform it to canonical data model.
// 3. Calculate average composite exchange rate using exchange rates from different exchanges.
// 4. Write the exchange rate into the database.

// Canonical representation of the BTC/USD exchange rate is a JSON object:
// {"BTC/USD":"9328.39","timestamp":"2018-04-30T19:51:12.876Z"}
