- xref:docs/configuration.adoc[Configuration]

== Features

- Workflow definition: Define workflows using a simple and flexible YAML syntax.
- Task scheduling: Schedule tasks to run at specific times or intervals.
- Task dependencies: Specify dependencies between tasks to ensure they run in the correct order.
- Flexible runtime: Support for running tasks in containers or on Kubernetes.
- Task logging: Logs for each task are available in the UI or through APIs.
- Error handling: Detect and handle task errors, with configurable retry logic.

== Getting Started

To get started with NoETL, follow the installation instructions in the documentation.

Once you have installed NoETL, you can define workflows using YAML files. See the workflow configuration guide for more details.

== AI/Machine Learning Functionality

NoETL workflow engine can be utilized to enable AI/Machine learning functionality by integrating AI/ML algorithms and models as tasks within the workflow. The following steps outline the process:

. Define the AI/ML task: The task to be executed should be defined, including the algorithm and/or model to be used, input data, and output data format.

. Prepare data: The data required for the task should be prepared. This may involve pre-processing, cleaning, and formatting the data to be compatible with the AI/ML algorithm or model.

. Configure the workflow: The workflow should be configured to incorporate the AI/ML task. This can be accomplished by creating a new job and task, and specifying the input and output data for the task.

. Execute the workflow: After configuring the workflow, execute it and track its progress.

. Analyze the results: Once the workflow is completed, analyze the results of the AI/ML task to determine whether the task was successful, and whether any additional actions are required.
