The noetl workflow engine can be used to enable AI/Machine learning functionality by incorporating AI/ML algorithms and models as tasks within the workflow. Here are the steps you can follow:

. Define the AI/ML task: Define the task to be executed, including the algorithm and/or model to be used, input data, and output data format.

. Prepare data: Prepare the data needed for the task. This could involve preprocessing, cleaning, and formatting the data to be compatible with the AI/ML algorithm or model.

. Configure the workflow: Configure the workflow to include the AI/ML task. This can be done by creating a new job and task, and specifying the input and output data for the task.

. Execute the workflow: Once the workflow is configured, execute it and monitor the progress.

. Analyze the results: Once the workflow completes, analyze the results of the AI/ML task to determine if the task was successful, and whether any further action is required.
